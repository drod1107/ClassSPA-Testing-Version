# ClassSPA-Testing-Version
New clone of October 2022 Class SPA

This version has been cloned off to provide a safe sandbox for working with Unit and E2E testing within a real-world context

Be sure to first run:
```javascript
$ npm i
```
...to install all dependencies before starting.

```javascript
$ npm run serve
```
Run this command in the terminal to render up a localhost version of the app to check out the navigation bar so you understand how it's intended to function before testing.

See curriculum section 10.2 for more detail on how to set up unit testing:
[Unit Testing with Jasmine and End to End Testing with Cypress](https://github.com/savvy-coders/sc-curriculum/blob/master/Section10/10.2-Unit-Testing.md)
